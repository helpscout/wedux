# Wedux

Wedux is a state management library for [React](https://reactjs.org/) applications.

It's inspired by the patterns of [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and the implementation [Unistore](https://github.com/developit/unistore). With a tiny library size of around 1.5kb gzipped, Wedux provides you the power of Redux (for most use-cases) with a minimal impact on bundle size - perfect for use in libraries!
